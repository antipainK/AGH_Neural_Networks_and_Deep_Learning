# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
###### This repository is not intended to be a `tutorial`, but can be used as a source of reference.
This project is a part of a Neural Networks and Deep Learning (pl. "Sieci Neuronowe i Uczenie Głębokie") course on Computer Science major at the AGH Academy of Science and Technology.

The <ins>main goal</ins> of this course is to <ins>gain insight into inner workings of neural networks</ins>.

## Details:

- Repository content
  - The directories respond to weekly laboratory exercises. Each of them include:
    - files named `lab1.ipynb` to `lab13.ipynb` - a file prepared by the university, which we're to modify to a working state
    - files named `SiNiUG_lab1.ipynb` to `SiNiUG_lab13.ipynb` - completed, working files
    - necessary external files (if needed)
    
- Environment:
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
